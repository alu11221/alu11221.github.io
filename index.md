# About Me

I am an aerospace engineer with an insatiable passion for flight. At the age of ten, I dove headfirst into model aviation, soon spending all of my spare time designing, building, and flying RC planes and drones. 

This hobby led me to pursue engineering at The Ohio State University, graduating in 2023 with a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering and a Minor in Robotics and Autonomous Systems. I eventually found my way to Seattle where I now work in commercial aviation, and where I have embraced my love for the outdoors. During a busy season of hiking and mountaineering, I also earned my private pilot license, turning a lifelong goal into reality. 

Today, I bring that same hands-on mindset and curiosity to every project I take on, combining technical rigor with a passion for innovation. Iâ€™m excited to keep building, learning, and contributing to the evolving world of aerospace.
