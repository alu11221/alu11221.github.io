## Intro
When I turned 16, I was lucky enough to land my childhood dream job at FliteTest, a company whose [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@FliteTest) had been a fundamental building block in my introduction to the RC hobby. As part of this job, I designed several RC airplane kits, which were - and for some, still are - sold through the FliteTest online store. These planes are primarily constructed from foamboard with some simple plywood parts, keeping them simple and low-cost for hobbyists of all backgrounds to enjoy.

Check out a few of my favorites below!

## FT X-29
I've always been fascinated by the X-29 for its unique configuration, innovative construction, and reliance on augmentation for control. It got me thinking - would it be possible to build a simple RC version? Turns out, after several prototypes and plenty of crashes to dial things in, absolutely!

## FT Edge
I've flown a wide variety of model aircraft over the years - EDF jets, helicopters, 50-lb tandem-wing abominations, you name it - but I keep coming back to aerobatic fixed-wing planes, a.k.a. "3D" planes. The Edge 540 is an iconic full-scale aerobatic monster, and I wanted to bring that to life in an RC form. The FT Edge is still sold on the [FliteTest store](https://store.flitetest.com/ft-edge-540-mkr2/).

## FT Goblin
Simple RC "plank" that was not so simple for me to figure out, but lots of iterations and testing produced a really smooth flier. Lesson learned on CG sensitivity on tailless airplanes.
