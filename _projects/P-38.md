## Intro

After building my 1:6-scale RC BF-109, I had to build an Allied fighter to pair with it. With its distinctive twin booms and commanding presence, the P-38 Lightning stood out to me as a clear choice. Both models were specifically made to be capable of slow flight to fly at an annual indoor RC festival in Ohio.

To this day, despite how long ago I built it, this is my favorite plane in my collection. No CAD, no fancy equipment - just an Exacto knife and a dream on a 14-year-old’s budget.

**Timeline:** November 2015 - January 2017

## The Build
### Internal Structure & Electronics
I found a 3-view online with cross-sections along the length of the plane. Construction began with the internal structure, with formers and stringers hand-cut from Dollar Tree foamboard. The foamboard was cheap and lightweight - perfect for building an indoor slow-flyer on a budget.

Joined the booms with the center fuselage pod. This project quickly outgrew the workbench in my childhood bedroom.

### Functional Fowler Flaps
I added movable fowler flaps, which were tricky to get right due to their combined translational and rotational motion. To minimize weight, the inboard and outboard fowler flap panels were driven by a single servo in each wing.

See the fowler flaps in action in the following video:

I installed the rest of the electronics - motors, ESCs, tail servos, receiver - and began forming the skin for the wings and fuselage. Note that the outboard wing panels are removable for ease of transportation.

### First Flight
With the electronics installed and most of the skin complete, it was ready for a maiden flight.

Things went smoothly until we smelled something burning, and discovered (after a safe landing) that some motor wire insulation had started to melt. I moved the ESCs to be closer to the motors, and replaced the wiring with shorter lengths of higher AWG silicone wire. 

### Paint & Finishing Touches
The airplane was now ready for final details and airbrushing. I made a mock cockpit, which is removable for access to internal electronics.

I chose to paint the plane in the colors of Thomas “Tommy” McGuire, the second-highest scoring American ace with 38 confirmed kills (right behind Richard Bong with 40 kills, who also flew a P-38). There is some uncertainty in his last moments, but he died during a dogfight, likely because he did not drop his drop tanks and stalled at low altitude. Lots of interesting history to dig into there.

Finally, the finished airplane, proudly on display at the 2017 NE Ohio Electric Festival. I flew it in a demo at this event, and again the following year. Talking to fellow RC pilots about the build and showing others what I made was incredibly rewarding, and made all of the long nights worthwhile.
