## Flying
As a kid, I always wanted to be a pilot. I first tried in 2021, but as a college student, the time and money caught up to me. In 2024, I finally made it happen, earning my private pilots license in 46 hours flying a Vans RV-12iS.

## Hiking
Aside from flying and tinkering, I have also discovered a passion for the outdoors. Growing up in Ohio, I didn't understand the allure of hiking - it's just walking, but harder. What's there to see, anyways? 

Things started changing when I moved to San Francisco for a summer internship. On the long drive from Ohio, I was astounded by the ever-changing landscapes around me. I started through familiar cornfields, then moved on to rolling hills, dramatic plateaus, and striking mountains as I drove further west. I visited the Great Salt Lake and the Bonneville Salt Flats of Utah and couldn't believe my eyes at Lake Tahoe before I finally arrived in SF. Soon after, I took a trip to Yosemite National Park with a few friends, and went on my first "real" hike to North Dome. I was very much unprepared - I wore old white sneakers and ran out of water - but it got me hooked.

Fast forward a few years. I'm now living in the PNW, and you're more likely to find me in the mountains than in my apartment. Many of my friends here also love the outdoors, and they have introduced me to hobbies like mountaineering that I hardly knew existed before. I've summitted 4 of the 5 total active volcanoes in Washington including Mt. Rainier/Tahoma, and consider myself incredibly lucky to regularly experience natural beauty of this caliber. Needless to say, I'm now addicted to type 2 fun.

## Photography
I recently got into photography, sometimes bringing my camera on hikes or planespotting with friends at local airports. I still have a lot to learn, but even casual photography has been a ton of fun.
